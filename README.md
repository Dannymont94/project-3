## Description 
From "Tiger King" to "Ozark" to "The Boys," it seems like a new TV show is trending every week of quarantine. TV Tracker is a MERN-Stack single-page application that allows users to track their all their TV shows in one place.

Use the search bar to find TV shows and track them as "Interested," "Watching," "Completed," or "Not Interested." You can also untrack a show at any time. Click on a poster to see more information from TVMaze.com. 

View and all your tracked shows from your profile page. The days of forgetting your friends' TV show recommendations are numbered!
