# Tv Tracker

## Description 
You have probably heard it, “Have you seen that new show about ..”, and you either have the reaction of, oh yeah I love it or looking at someone blankly.  With so many tv shows out there, how do you keep track of it all?  

Well now you have that opportunity with Tv Tracker.  Tv Tracker allows you to search for tv shows and indicate if your interest level in various tv shows.  Once you start watching you can track that you have started and when you finish your binge, you can mark it as complete.  

So the next time you get the question, you can open Tv Tracker and checkout if you are interested in the show.  Or you are scrolling through one of the various streaming platforms, not knowing what to watch, you’ll have Tv Tracker to aid you.
